Given an array S of n integers, are there elements a, b, c, and d in S such that
a + b + c + d = target?

Find all unique quadruplets in the array which gives the
sum of target.

Note:
- Elements in a quadruplet (a,b,c,d) must be in non-descending order. 
(ie, a ≤ b ≤ c ≤ d)

- The solution set must not contain duplicate quadruplets.
